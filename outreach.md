Title: Outreach
---

I have experience in outreach and engagement work to a variety of audiences, from primary school pupils to adults. Below is a selection of different work I have been part of. Please contact me (at the bottom of the page) if you are interested in me delivering outreach to your organisation.

###I'm A Space Person
['I'm a Space Person'](https://spaceperson.co.uk/) is a space careers resource aimed at upper-primary and lower-secondary school pupils. It focusses on representing the UK space sector and the available jobs, giving examples of possible UK-based employers. Children are encouraged to see these jobs as being for 'people like me' by describing themselves using a series of attributes and finding which of these careers best suits this description of them. This work has led to a [peer-reviewed publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-5-119-2022), presentations at [EGU](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-9402), and a tour of the UK led by the UK Space Agency attended by over 100,000 members of the public.

###Great Exhibition Road Festival
The [Great Exhibition Road Festival](https://www.greatexhibitionroadfestival.co.uk/) is a free annual celebration of science and the arts each summer in South Kensington, led by Imperial College London in collaboration with other institutions on and around Exhibiton Road. It hosts a series of interactive workshops, talks, and installations surrounding science and the arts for all ages. My engagement with this event has included holding stands related to space careers and representing Comet Interceptor. In 2025, this was attended by 55,000 visitors across two days.

###Imperial Lates
[Imperial Lates](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/lates/) are post-work fun and social events aimed at adults to engage with the latest research taking place at Imperial College London. Each of these evenings have a theme. I have given a talk about women working in space research, and run stalls about spacecraft magnetometers constructed at Imperial and Solar Orbiter.
